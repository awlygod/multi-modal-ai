->Built a multimodal AI model for video sentiment and emotion analysis, leveraging PyTorch to process video, audio,
  and text inputs.
->Trained the model with advanced features like video frame extraction, audio feature extraction, and text embedding
  using BERT, incorporating multimodal fusion for classification. Deployed the model on AWS SageMaker and utilized
  AWS S3 for secure video storage and scalable inference.
->Developed a SaaS platform using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, providing API key management, user authentication
  with Auth.js, and usage quota tracking.
->Delivered real-time analysis results with a modern UI, enabling users to gain insights from uploaded videos efficiently
